          <h2>What do you mean by Heart Attack Risk?</h2>
          <p>
          Heart attack risk refers to the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack, which occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked, typically by a buildup of plaque in the arteries. Several factors can contribute to an increased risk of heart attack, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, family history of heart disease, age, and a sedentary lifestyle. By identifying and managing these risk factors, individuals can reduce their risk of experiencing a heart attack and improve their overall heart health.

          You can Predict whether you got heart attack or not by providing some inputs in our 
          <Link to="/health-analysis/heart-attack-risk-predictor"> heart attack risk predictor (HARP)</Link> 
          section.
        </p>
        <p>There are few parameter which you need to know, before having any input.</p>
        <div>
          <h3>Diastolic BP </h3>
          <p>Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is relaxed and filling with blood, between contractions or heartbeats. It is usually the second (lower) number in a blood pressure reading and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).</p>
          <p>A normal range for diastolic blood pressure is typically considered to be between 60 and 80 mmHg.</p>
          <p>High diastolic blood pressure, also known as diastolic hypertension, occurs when the diastolic reading is consistently above 80 mmHg, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other health complications.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Red Blood Cells</h3>
          <p>Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are cells in the blood that carry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and transport carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs for exhalation. They get their red color from a protein called hemoglobin, which binds to oxygen and gives the cells their ability to carry it.</p>
          <p>Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow and have a lifespan of about 120 days before they are broken down and replaced.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Sedimantation Rate</h3>
          <p>Sedimentation rate, also known as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), is a blood test that measures the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube in a specified amount of time.</p>
          <p>In the context of heart attack risk, an elevated ESR may indicate the presence of inflammation in the body, which can be a risk factor for developing heart disease. Inflammation can cause damage to the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to the formation of plaque and increasing the risk of a heart attack.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Serum Albumin</h3>
          <p>Serum albumin is a protein made by the liver and is an important component of the blood. In the context of heart attack risk, low levels of serum albumin have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Serum Cholesterol</h3>
          <p>Serum cholesterol is a measurement of the amount of cholesterol in the blood. High levels of serum cholesterol can increase the risk of developing heart disease, including heart attacks. Cholesterol can build up in the walls of arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow to the heart, which can lead to a heart attack.</p>
          <p>Therefore, monitoring serum cholesterol levels and taking steps to keep them in a healthy range can help lower the risk of heart attack.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Serum Iron </h3>
          <p>Serum iron is not considered a major risk factor for heart attack. However, high levels of serum iron can cause oxidative stress, which can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases over time. Iron overload disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis have been associated with an increased risk of heart attack, but this is not related to serum iron levels alone. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Serum Magnesium</h3>
          <p>There is some evidence that low levels of serum magnesium may increase the risk of heart disease. Magnesium plays an important role in regulating heart function, blood pressure, and glucose metabolism.</p>
          <p> Low magnesium levels may contribute to high blood pressure, insulin resistance, and inflammation, all of which are risk factors for heart disease.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Serum Protein</h3>
          <p>Serum protein refers to the total amount of protein found in the blood serum. It includes different types of proteins such as albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen. </p>
          <p>The level of serum protein can be measured through a blood test and is an important indicator of overall health. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Systolic BP</h3>
          <p>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the pressure exerted by blood against the walls of arteries when the heart contracts and pumps blood out. It is the top number in a blood pressure reading and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). </p>
          <p>A normal range for SBP is considered to be below 120 mm Hg. High SBP is a risk factor for many health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)</h3>
          <p>Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) is a blood test that measures the blood's ability to bind iron with transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood. TIBC can provide useful information about the body's iron status, including the risk of iron deficiency anemia. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>TS</h3>
          <p>TS stands for Transferrin Saturation, which is a laboratory value that measures the amount of iron bound to transferrin in the blood. Transferrin is a protein that binds to iron and transports it through the bloodstream to the bone marrow, where it is used in the production of new red blood cells.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>White Blood Cells</h3>
          <p>White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are a type of blood cell that is responsible for protecting the body against infections and diseases. They are an important part of the immune system and are produced in the bone marrow. </p>
          <p>The normal range of white blood cells in the blood is typically between 4,000 and 11,000 cells per microliter. High or low levels of white blood cells can indicate a variety of medical conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancers.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>BMI</h3>
          <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is commonly used to determine whether someone is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.</p>
          <p>Studies have shown that a higher BMI is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, as well as other health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Pulse Pressure</h3>
          <p>Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. </p>
          <p>Elevated pulse pressure can be a risk factor for heart disease, especially in individuals over the age of 50. A high pulse pressure can indicate stiff arteries or increased resistance to blood flow, which can put a strain on the heart and increase the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular events.</p>
