            Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body is unable to
            properly produce or use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood
            sugar levels.
          </p>
          <h5>There are two main types of diabetes:</h5>
          <ul>

              <strong>Type 1 diabetes:</strong> which is usually diagnosed in
              children and young adults and occurs when the body does not

            </li>

          <h3 className="mt-5">Pregnancies</h3>
          <p>
            In the context of diabetic disease, "Pregnancies" typically refers
            to the number of times a woman has been pregnant. It is a variable
            that may be taken into account when assessing the risk or severity
            of diabetes in women. For example, women who have had multiple
            pregnancies may be at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes
            or type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The range of values for the variable "Pregnancies" is typically
            between 0 to 17. However, the exact range may vary depending on the
            dataset being used.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a study of diabetic patients, the average number of pregnancies
            was found to be around 3.8.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5">Glucose</h3>
          <p>
            Glucose is a type of sugar that is present in the blood and used by
            the body for energy. In the context of diabetes, glucose levels can
            be used to diagnose and monitor the disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a person has diabetes, their body is not able to regulate
            glucose levels properly, leading to high levels of glucose in the
            blood. This can cause a range of symptoms and complications if left
            untreated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Glucose levels are typically measured in milligrams per deciliter
            (mg/dL) in the blood. In diabetic disease dataset, Glucose refers to
            the fasting blood sugar level measured in mg/dL.
          </p>
          <p>
            In diabetic disease, the range and average value of glucose (blood
            sugar) can vary depending on the specific type and severity of the
            condition. However, in general:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Normal fasting blood glucose levels for adults are typically
              between 70 and 99 mg/dL (3.9 to 5.5 mmol/L).
            </li>
            <li>
              A diagnosis of diabetes is typically made if a person has a
              fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on
              two separate occasions.
            </li>
            <li>
              For people with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association (ADA)
              recommends a target range for blood glucose levels of 80-130 mg/dL
              (4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L) before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL (10.0
              mmol/L) two hours after starting a meal.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's important to note that glucose levels that are too high or too
            low can be dangerous and lead to serious health complications.
            People with diabetes should work closely with their healthcare
            provider to manage their blood glucose levels within a safe and
            healthy range.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5">Blood Pressure</h3>
          <p>
            Blood pressure refers to the force of blood against the walls of
            arteries as it circulates through the body. In the context of
            diabetes, high blood pressure (also known as hypertension) can
            increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other complications.
            Monitoring and controlling blood pressure levels is an important
            part of diabetes management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blood pressure is measured using two numbers: systolic pressure (the
            top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number), both
            expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A normal blood pressure
            reading is typically around 120/80 mmHg.
          </p>
          <p>
            In diabetic disease, the blood pressure range can vary, but it is
            generally recommended to keep blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg to
            reduce the risk of complications. However, individual targets may
            vary based on age, overall health, and other factors, and should be
            determined in consultation with a healthcare provider.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5">Skin Thickness</h3>
          <p>
            Skin thickness in diabetic disease refers to the thickness of the
            skin in certain areas of the body. In diabetes, skin thickness is
            typically measured at specific locations, such as the back of the
            triceps or the thigh. This measurement can help assess the risk of
            certain diabetes-related complications, such as neuropathy or
            ulcers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skin thickness can vary widely among individuals, but in general,
            normal skin thickness is between 1.5-2.5 mm. In diabetes, skin
            thickness measurements may range from 0.5-3.0 mm, with an average
            thickness of around 1.5-2.0 mm.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's important to note that skin thickness can be
            influenced by factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity, and can
            also vary depending on the specific location of the measurement.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5">Insulin</h3>
          <p>
            Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate
            the levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. In diabetic disease, the
            body either does not produce enough insulin or is not able to use it
            properly, which can lead to high blood sugar levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Insulin levels can be measured through a blood test, and people with
            diabetes may need to take insulin injections or use other
            medications to help manage their blood sugar levels.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5">BMI</h3>
          <p>
            BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and
            weight. It is a commonly used indicator of whether a person is
            underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. In diabetic
            disease, BMI can be used as a risk factor for the development of
            type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight, a BMI between
            18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal, a BMI between 25 and 29.9 is
            considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher is considered
            obese.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure of body
            fat and should be interpreted along with other factors such as waist
            circumference, muscle mass, and overall health status.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5">Diabetes Pedigree Function</h3>
          <p>
            The Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) is a score that provides
            information about the risk of developing diabetes based on a
            person's family history of the disease. It is a measure of the
            genetic influence on the development of diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DPF score ranges from 0 to 2.5, with higher scores indicating a
            stronger genetic influence. A score of 0 means there is no genetic
            influence, while a score of 2.5 indicates a very strong genetic
            influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DPF is calculated by looking at the family history of diabetes,
            including the number of relatives who have diabetes, their age at
            diagnosis, and how closely they are related to the person being
            assessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In diabetic disease, the average value of the DPF is around 0.5,
            with a range of 0 to 2.5. However, it is important to note that a
            high DPF score does not necessarily mean that a person will develop
            diabetes, as other factors such as lifestyle and environmental
            factors also play a role in the development of the disease.
